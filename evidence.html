    <h1>Evidence supporting the argument</h1>

    <div class="subchunk">
      Multiple studies and industry reports back the main points: research shows AI tools can speed routine engineering tasks but may also produce insecure or incorrect code unless humans check outputs; government and research groups warn of security and reliability risks for AI-generated code and recommend formal risk management steps for teams.
    </div>

    <div class="subchunk">
      For example, work from policy researchers and cybersecurity teams documents how AI code generation can introduce vulnerabilities and supply insecure patterns, while major developer-tool vendors report both productivity gains and the need for review; likewise, technical analyses explain why large language models sometimes invent facts or plausible-looking but false outputs, which means teams must verify important claims.

    <div class="subchunk">
      Taken together, these findings show that AI offers clear efficiency benefits while also posing real risks that organizations must manage with policies, audits, and human oversight.
