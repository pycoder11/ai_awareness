    <h1>Evidence supporting the argument</h1>

  Evidence from research and real workplace examples I feel shows the pros and cons of AI in IT companies. Studies show that AI helps workers complete routine tasks more quickly, such as writing basic code or searching for information, which helps them get to the complicated things faster. However, many companies have noticed that some employees struggle to explain AI-generated work. LLMs can also generate answers that sound correct but contain errors, and this can lead to software bugs and security issues when the output isn't carefully checked. These examples show that while AI can improve efficiency, overreliance on it can severely hinder our creativity or responsibility.
