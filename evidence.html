    <h2>Research Studies</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      Academic and industry studies show that AI improves developer productivity by automating routine coding tasks, reducing debugging time, and helping employees learn new technologies faster. For example, a 2023 survey from TechRepublic found that IT teams using AI tools reported a 30–40% reduction in time spent on repetitive tasks.

    <h2>Industry Examples</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      Companies like Microsoft integrate AI-powered assistants such as GitHub Copilot into their software teams. These tools are widely used for generating code, creating documentation, and performing tests. While productivity gains are significant, reports from developers indicate that some AI-generated code contains subtle bugs, and overreliance can lead to knowledge gaps.

    <h2>Professional Commentary</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      Analysis from cybersecurity experts shows that AI-generated code may introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully reviewed. LLMs can produce outputs that appear correct but hide security risks, making human oversight essential. These insights highlight the importance of combining AI efficiency with critical thinking and verification.
