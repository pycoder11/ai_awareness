      <h1>Evidence & Sources</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Key claims and supporting evidence</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Students using AI instead of learning</dt>
          <dd>Survey responses and classroom observations show many students using AI to polish or produce assignments; anecdote from Green Level student who couldn’t explain their paper.</dd>

          <dt>AI hallucinations spread misinformation</dt>
          <dd>Scholarly and news sources (see Works Cited) indicate generative models sometimes invent facts and create convincing but false content.</dd>

          <dt>Workplace automation and opacity</dt>
          <dd>Reporting on algorithmic decision-making demonstrates risk of bias, lack of transparency, and lack of appeal.</dd>

        <h2>Interviews (selected)</h2>
        <article class="interview">
          <h3>Murali — software industry veteran</h3>
          <p>Key point: AI speeds mundane work but requires technical expertise to filter errors. Concern: younger users may over-rely on AI and lose critical skills.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="interview">
          <h3>Ashwani — consultant</h3>
          <p>Key point: AI is useful for repetitive tasks and efficiency. Optimistic about students learning as before and using AI when needed.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Survey summary</h2>
        <p>~200 responses collected. Most use AI to save time (emails, research, study help). Majority see benefits, but many worry that AI could make users lazier or less skilled. A large minority believe the benefits outweigh downsides.</p>
        <p><strong>Local implication:</strong> majority opinion does not mean responsible use — it means policy and instruction are still necessary.</p>
