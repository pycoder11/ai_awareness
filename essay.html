        <h2>Opening: the moment that matters</h2>
        <p>I fed my history teacher’s prompt into an AI detector. The result: <em>Your Text is AI/GPT Generated.</em> My heart dropped. In that single moment I saw how ordinary it has become to let technology do the thinking for us at Green Level High School. I also realized how invisible that help is — and how dangerous.</p>

        <h2>AI in the classroom: shortcut or sabotage?</h2>
        <p>AI can accelerate tasks and provide immediate feedback. But that speed is not always a virtue. When students use AI to generate essays, they trade practice (the thing that builds reasoning) for convenience. As one study notes, generative AI can simplify the writing process while limiting students’ capacity for deep thinking and critical skill acquisition. <strong>Access is not the same as understanding.</strong></p>
        <p>At Green Level, I’ve seen students submit work they cannot explain. That’s not learning — it’s passing.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Hallucinations and truth</h2>
        <p>Generative models can invent facts with confidence. Those invented facts spread quickly and are often trusted because they read and sound authoritative. If students accept AI’s confident output without verification, we risk a generation that values fluency over evidence. Schools must teach verification as a core skill — not an optional add-on.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Workplace risks: opacity and fairness</h2>
        <p>AI systems used for hiring, scoring, and evaluation can introduce errors and biases at scale. When an algorithm makes a decision in secret, affected individuals lose context, correction, and appeal. We cannot outsource fairness to functions we do not understand.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What I am not saying</h2>
        <p>I do not recommend banning AI. Properly used, it can be an extraordinary tutor and productivity booster. But the key distinction matters: <em>giving people access to AI does not guarantee they understand the content it produces.</em> Without intentional instruction, AI becomes a crutch.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Recommendations — preserve the benefits, prevent the harms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Adopt explicit school policies that define allowed and disallowed AI uses and consequences.</li>
          <li>Teach AI literacy: how to verify, how to spot hallucinations, how to use AI as a learning tool.</li>
          <li>Require workplace transparency, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms for automated decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These measures preserve AI's advantages — speed and scalability — while protecting learning, fairness, and truth.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion — a hopeful warning</h2>
        <p>AI can be our assistant — if we teach methods. If we teach shortcuts, AI becomes our master. The question for Green Level and beyond is not whether we will use AI; it is whether we will choose to think. I am hopeful: with rules, literacy, and oversight, technology can amplify rather than erase our best human capacities.</p>
