    <h2>Thesis</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are transforming IT companies, helping developers complete tasks faster and more efficiently. While these tools improve productivity, they also create challenges such as overreliance on AI, loss of critical skills, and potential security risks. I argue that AI should be used as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human expertise.

    <h2>Background and Context</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      AI has rapidly advanced in the last decade, especially through the development of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s Codex and GPT models. These tools can assist developers by generating code snippets, suggesting fixes, and even documenting systems. Major IT companies, including Microsoft, Google, and smaller startups in the Research Triangle Park (Raleigh, Durham, and Cary, NC), now integrate AI tools into daily workflows. Understanding the background and development of these tools is essential to evaluating their benefits and risks.

    <div class="subchunk">
      In addition, AI adoption affects both junior and senior developers. While juniors may rely heavily on AI, experienced developers are needed to verify outputs, catch subtle errors, and maintain secure systems. This dynamic creates an ongoing balance between efficiency and expertise.

    <h2>Significance to IT Professionals</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      For people working in IT, AI can reduce repetitive work and accelerate project timelines. However, misuse or overreliance can lead to overlooked errors, skill degradation, and even security vulnerabilities. Understanding these trade-offs is critical for IT professionals and decision-makers in the Research Triangle area and beyond.
