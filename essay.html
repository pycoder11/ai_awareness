    <h1>Is artificial intelligence helping or hurting IT companies?</h1>

    <p>
      <p>
  After the recent breakthroughs in LLM models, artificial intelligence is now widely used in IT companies. Many developers use AI to help write code, fix bugs, and complete tasks faster. This can improve productivity, but I think it also creates a multitude of problems. When people rely too much on AI, they may stop practicing important skills like problem solving and critical thinking. Many people can fall victim to AI answers without fully understanding them, which can lead to mistakes that are extremely difficult to debug. These errors can be dangerous, especially in areas like cybersecurity and data management. Overall, I think AI should be used as a tool to strictly help humans, not replace them.
