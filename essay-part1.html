    <h1>AI in IT Companies - Part 1</h1>

    <h2>Thesis</h2>
    <p>
      The impact of AI tools on IT companies is that they help developers to work quicker and more efficiently. While AI is a good productivity booster, it causes problems like over-dependence on it, depletion of technical skills, and potential security threats. Because of this, AI should only be used as a support system that just helps human workers rather than actually replacing our human knowledge and judgment.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Within the last 10 years, AI has really been advancing a lot, especially with the introduction of large language models, including ChatGPT and Copilot. These tools are very useful in modern IT because they can create code easily, help with documentation, and debug software. Microsoft, Google and firms like Red Hat in the Research Triangle Park area use AI a lot in their day-to-day development activities. Although these tools make the work more effective, the impact of the tools changes the way in which developers learn and approach the problem-solving process, particularly among lesser experienced workers.

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>
      AI can boost workplace productivity by redoing repetitive work, processing information at lightning speed, or producing rough draft reports. But if introduced without due guidelines, it can sacrifice fairness and work quality. Automatic screening, scoring and testing programs have already demonstrated how errors and bias can have adverse effects on individuals where no human looks at the output of a machine. In essence, we risk building systems where a flawed algorithm, not a qualified person, determines someone’s future. This highlights that when algorithms make decisions in secret, workers lose the right to context, correction, and appeal, which makes transparency and human oversight indispensable. Companies must clarify how and when they deploy AI, and workers must be afforded an opportunity to appeal against decisions by algorithms. Legislators and business executives must consider AI as a workplace instrument that demands workplace safety regulation and ethical analysis, in other words, not something to be deployed without thought. I do not recommend a ban on AI. Quite the opposite, properly used, it can be a wonderful teacher and productivity booster. The key is to make a distinction between access and understanding. Giving students access to AI is no guarantee that they will understand the substance; providing workers with AI tools is no guarantee that they will have their job secured without safeguards in place.
