    <h1>Survey and interview results</h1>

<p>
  <p>
  A survey of about 200 people who work in IT showed that AI is commonly used in everyday work, and many said they use AI to help write code, understand documentation, fix errors, and find information faster. Most people agreed that AI saves time and makes work easier; however, many people were also worried about becoming too dependent on AI and losing important problem-solving skills. These concerns were supported by interviews with two professionals, Ashwani and Murali. Ashwani explained that AI can be helpful for speeding up work, but developers still need to understand the code they use so they can build off of it when AI fails, and Murali pointed out that AI answers can seem correct while hiding mistakes, which can cause problems if they are not carefully checked. Overall, the survey and interviews show that AI is useful in IT, but it must be used in the right way.
