    <h2>Survey Results</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      A survey of 200 IT professionals revealed widespread use of AI in daily workflows. Many reported using AI to write code snippets, debug programs, and locate documentation faster. Most participants agreed that AI saves time and reduces frustration. However, a significant number expressed concern about overreliance on AI and its impact on problem-solving skills.

    <h2>Interviews with Professionals</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      Interviews with two IT professionals, Ashwani and Murali, supported these findings. Ashwani emphasized that AI speeds up routine work but stressed the importance of understanding the code generated by AI. Murali noted that AI outputs can appear correct but sometimes conceal errors, which can cause serious issues in production systems if unchecked.

    <h2>Implications for IT Professionals</h2>
    <div class="subchunk">
      The survey and interviews confirm that AI is useful, but professional oversight remains essential. IT professionals should adopt best practices such as verifying AI-generated outputs, continuously practicing critical skills, and documenting AI use to ensure both efficiency and security.

      These real-world insights reinforce the argument that AI should be a supportive tool rather than a replacement. By understanding both benefits and risks, IT professionals can leverage AI responsibly to maintain productivity while preserving essential skills.
