    <h1>AI in IT Companies - Part 3</h1>

    <h2>Survey Results</h2>
    <p>
      In a survey I sent to 200 people, I found out that most people make use of AI tools to write basic code, debug errors, and write emails. In general, the majority of the respondents said that AI saves time and lowers frustration. However, some of the participants were also afraid of overtrusting AI and forgetting about critical ways of solving problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      Interviews with IT professionals Ashwani and Murali supported the survey findings: Ashwani explained that AI is useful for speeding up routine work, but also mentioned that it is essential to actually understand the code being produced. Also, Murali said that AI-generated code may appear correct when really, the code has tons of errors, which can cause serious problems if not reviewed carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      According to the survey and interviews, AI is beneficial, but it is necessary to have a human to verify it. We should examine AI-generated code, keep practicing the common technical skills, and to use AI as an educational aid, not a substitute. If we do it right, we can achieve way more efficiency, as well as long-term software quality.
    </p>

    <h2>Connection to Thesis</h2>
    <p>
      AI should continue to function as a supportive tool, not as a replacement for human expertise. While AI improves speed and productivity, human judgment is necessary to prevent errors, protect security, and maintain professional skill development.
