      <h1>Survey Results & Interview Highlights</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Survey snapshot (n ≈ 200)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Most common uses: polishing emails, research help, studying aid.</li>
          <li>Most common reason: save time / get tasks done quicker.</li>
          <li>Concerns reported: becoming lazier, losing skills, over-reliance on AI.</li>
          <li>Majority outcome: many still believe AI's benefits outweigh downsides — but many simultaneously worry about misuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interpretation: the community values AI for convenience but lacks a shared framework for responsible use.</p>

        <article>
          <h3>Murali — software veteran</h3>
          <blockquote>“It sped up mundane tasks, but expertise is still paramount. AI provides noise; you still need technical skill to sift the signal.”</blockquote>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Ashwani — consultant</h3>
          <blockquote>“AI is a tool to accelerate innovation, but high-level thinking should come from people.”</blockquote>

      <section>
        <h2>What the data suggests</h2>
        <p>There is a gap: users know the risks intellectually but may not have guidance on how to employ AI responsibly day-to-day. Closing that gap is where schools and workplaces must act.</p>
