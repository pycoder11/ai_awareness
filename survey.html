    <h1>Survey and interview summary</h1>

    <div class="subchunk">
      A survey of about 200 people who work in IT found that most use AI for tasks like code snippets, documentation, and quick debugging, and many said it saves time and reduces frustration; at the same time a large share reported concern about losing problem-solving experience and about trusting results without verification.

    <div class="subchunk">
      Interviews with two experienced professionals reinforced these views: Ashwani said AI is useful for speeding work but warned developers must still understand and test the code they accept, and Murali emphasized that AI answers can look correct even when they hide subtle bugs.
