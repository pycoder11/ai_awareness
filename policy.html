      <h1>Policy Recommendations & Student Pledge</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Suggested school policy (short version)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Define allowed uses:</strong> brainstorming, outlines, citation help with explicit teacher approval.</li>
          <li><strong>Define disallowed uses:</strong> submitting auto-generated text or code as original work.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification expectations:</strong> students must show process work and sources for major assignments.</li>
          <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> clear, proportional academic consequences and opportunities to learn (not just punish).</li>
          <li><strong>AI literacy:</strong> mandatory lesson on verification, hallucinations, and ethical use.</li>

        <h2>Sample classroom requirement (for teachers)</h2>
        <p>For essay assignments: require a short process write-up (drafts, notes, and a paragraph explaining what was AI-assisted and what was student-generated). Teachers reserve the right to request oral explanation of key ideas.</p>

          <h3>Green Level Responsible AI Pledge</h3>
          <p>I pledge to use AI tools responsibly: to learn, not to replace my thinking. I will disclose when AI helped me, verify AI-generated claims, and seek feedback to ensure I am learning the skills my assignments are meant to teach.</p>

          <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> Adopt a short AI policy and require process evidence.</li>
