    <h1>AI in IT Companies - Part 2</h1>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      However, AI is an extremely useful tool if used the right way. Research shows that AI tools enhance productivity by allowing developers to write more code in a shorter time, debug code more efficiently in most cases, and learn new technologies. According to a GitHub Developer Survey, more than 90 percent of the developers have been using AI tools in their workflow, and a significant percentage of them believe these tools make their life easier by spending less time on simple tasks. This demonstrates that when used appropriately, AI helps rather than hurts us.
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
      Nowadays, AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot are often used in the IT sector to help developers create code, documentation, and testing. Although there are productivity improvements, to avoid long-term problems, it must be emphasized that AI-generated codes may have errors or inefficient logic, which need to be thoroughly reviewed by a human expert to get the most out of it.
    </p>

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>
      Experts in cybersecurity warn that code created by AI creates security problems unless it's looked over by someone experienced. GitHub Security Lab describes that AI lacks knowledge of security context, and can propose unsafe code patterns, and a 2023 report by Snyk has determined that AI-generated code frequently contains a vulnerable dependency. These results demonstrate that AI tools need to be checked by qualified specialists to avoid risks and remain secure systems.
